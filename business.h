/*
 * File: business.h
 * ----------------
 * This file exports a class <code>business</code>. Business frame would
 * include several <code>Button</code>. Mouse event would be realized first,
 * key Event would be considered later.
 * Things could be bought from businessman(each costs $50):
 *      HP  +100
 *      ATK +5
 *      DEF +5
 *      EXP +100
 * TO Do: you would get a random key after you have consumed $100 with
 * [90% nothing, 9% yellow key, 0.9% blue key, 0.1% red key].
